# Linking the library

Hit **Command+B** to build the project. This will invoke the debug build process and
attempt to build your library. At this point, the process is most likely to fail,
but if it succeeds you need to temporarily disable the **Remove Phase**.

When the build is finished, navigate to **Product > Show Build Folder in Finder**.

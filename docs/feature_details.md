# Feature details

## What this library is & isn't

This library is nothing but a code generator that helps your Flutter/Dart functions call Rust functions. Therefore, you may refer to external materials to learn Flutter, learn Rust, learn [Flutter FFI](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/platform-integration/c-interop) (Dart FFI) and so on. With material on the Internet, you will know how to create a mobile application using Flutter, and how that app can call Rust functions via Dart FFI (in the C ABI). Then this package comes in, and ease you from the burden to write down tons of boilerplate code ;)

## Details

Here is a list of types that the code generator can generate:

[WIP] You can read the `pure_dart` example code currently, before I put the full list here.

Here are other functionalities:

[WIP] (e.g. [Stream is supported but not documented yet](https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_rust_bridge/issues/179)).
